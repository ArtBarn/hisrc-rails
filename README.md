The one I like the most is [HiSRC](https://github.com/teleject/hisrc). This gem makes your live easier through two steps:

* It adds HiSRC to the Rails asset pipeline â€“ no more messing around with javascript files.
* It provides a helper method to easy include HiSRC in your Rails views.

## Installation

In your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'hisrc-rails'
```

In your `application.js`:

```js
//= require hisrc

$(function() {
  $('img').hisrc();
});
```

For detailed information about available configuration options be sure to checkout the [HiSRC readme](https://github.com/teleject/hisrc#setting-up).

## Usage

`hisrc-rails` provides a nice little helper method to optimize your views: `responsive_image_tag`

`responsive_image_tag` accepts the same options as +image_tag+, and two additional options as well:

* <tt>:'1x'</tt> - If no 1x option is provided, the +src+ is used.
* <tt>:'2x'</tt> - If no 2x options is provided, "@2x" is added to the +src+. So "rails.png" becomes "rails@2x.png".

## Examples
```ruby
responsive_image_tag("rails.png")
  # => <img src="/assets/rails.png" data-1x="/assets/rails.png" data-2x="/assets/rails@2x.png" />

responsive_image_tag("http://placehold.it/100x100", :'1x' => "http://placehold.it/200x200", :'2x' => "http://placehold.it/400x400")
  # => <img src="http://placehold.it/100x100" data-1x="http://placehold.it/200x200" data-2x="http://placehold.it/200x200" />
```
